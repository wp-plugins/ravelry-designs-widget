Display your own knitting & crochet designs straight from Ravelry.

== Description ==

As a Ravelry designer it's important to also have details of your knitting / crochet patterns on your own website. 
With this plugin it's as easy as filling in your Rav designer name, choosing some basic options, and that's it!

Current features include:

* Shortcode now available
* Two layouts
* Change number of patterns shown
* Open links in same or new window/tab
* Most recent design displayed first

Features soon to be added:

* Alternative design sorting options
* Show / hide pattern price

**Usage**

Activate the widget by dragging "Ravelry Designs" into any widget area from the Appearance > Widgets admin screen. Fill in all options, and hit save.

SHORTCODE

To display patterns inside a post or page rather than a widget area, you need a shortcode.

Default settings:

`[sb_ravelry_designs]`

Custom settings:

`[sb_ravelry_designs designer=”michelle may” layout=”layout_2” show=”3” cols=”3”]`

For more info on available options and defaults please see [the plugin release page](http://codebyshellbot.com/wordpress-plugins/ravelry-designs-widget/ "Ravelry Designs Widget")

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does my layout look all wrong? =

Different themes will have different CSS of their own that could interfere with styling from the plugin. 
Ravelry Designs Widget has been tested with many common themes, but there's always one!

The solution for every theme will be different, but if you're unfamiliar with CSS and need some help 
please post in [the plugin support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ravelry-designs-widget) with a link to your site.
You can also pop into [the plugin thread](http://www.ravelry.com/discuss/giddy-knitters/2993075/) in my Ravelry group.
